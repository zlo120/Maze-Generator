# Maze-Generator
This is a re-upload of a group assignment completed at QUT for CAB302 in 2022, members of this group who all contributed to this project were Jungwoo Cho, Kyoung Young Min, Gippeum Kwoen and myself. 

This application is capable of creating a randomly generated maze of size N*M and is also capable of solving it (if possible).
